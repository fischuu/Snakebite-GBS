# First, create a liftover for the mock to the existing reference genome:
https://github.com/fischuu/transanno

# To compare two samples from a vcf, one can do the following...
bcftools view -Oz -c1 -s sample1 joined.vcf.gz > sample1.vcf.gz
bcftools view -Oz -c1 -s sample2 joined.vcf.gz > sample2.vcf.gz

and then compare them

bcftools stats sample1.vcf.gz sample2.vcf.gz > joined.stats.txt
