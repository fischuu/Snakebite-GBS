0.17.* UPDATES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
42: Table design in Markdown adjusted
41: Cosmetics for finalReport, status messages printed into the final report were removed.
40: Plenty of scatterplots added to related metrics to sequencing depth
39: More exportable tables added
38: Harmonised the plot colours in the final report
37: Added more descriptions to the final report
36: Deduplication vs Coverage plot added
35: QC tables display now the full dataset, without any threshold
34: QC tables can now be exported
33: Server config information added to the reports
32: QC plots now show ommit the missing R2 output (and do not duplicate R1 to pretend it to be R2)
31: Expection added in finalReport in case FastQC/MultiQC report different binnings in their reports for R1 and R2
30: Internal improvement: Duplicated Chunk names in report-knitr files are allowed
29: Paths in the configuration file can now be relative
28: Special case for flanking site determination caught (in case alignment starts at base 0, bed could have been negativ)
27: FinalReport polished and more statistics added
26: Chapter "Individual analysis" added to the finalReport
25: FinalReport: The ACGT-plot was improved in readability
24: FinalReport: Total sequences stats report now table with samples with less than 100k reads 
23: Bugfix, flanking sequence extraction ignored the first alignment
22: flanking bed files are now tab-delimted, as reqired by bedtools
21: Header lines removed from Stringtie output to ensure strict gtf compatability
20: Variant calling missingnes in percentages are now displayed on a fixed 0-100 scale
19: Added the Gini coefficient to represent the concentration of reads against the different alignment loci
18: Added the correlation plot for th loci aligned to reference genome
17: Critical bugfix in 'Mockrefloci_vs_samplealignments' that crashed the pipeline byt wrong output-filename
16: QC diverging samples are now printed for upper and lower throeshols in finalReport
15: Missing percentages are now always displayed on a scale between 0 and 100%
14: summaryTable cluster to reference genome added to the final report
13: Caught the special case, if the "genome" is also part of the filename of "genome" that produced an error
12: Dependency of preliminary mock vcf added to the report to avoid errors
11: QC module cleaned up (needs still a little)
10: Added a fasta-index dependency to avoid crashes in case fasta index was not created before stats are calculated
9: Fixed hard-coded link to docker container in Module 3 (r-gbs)
8: Special case caught, in case a reference aligned bam is empty
7: Flanking sites from individual alignments are now extracted
6: Input bug in the preparesamplesheet.R script fixed (tab-delimited input enforced)
5: Removed for the time-being the R2 reads from raw-read FastQC, due to some bug in function.
4: Created functions to handle individual fastq files in FastQC report
3: Variant Calling report added
2: Added a server-small config to downscale the server requirements for smaller projects
1: Define a TMPDIR for the create vertical ref rules, as it seems to crash for large datasets when the system default tmp folder is small
